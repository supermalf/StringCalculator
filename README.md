String Calculator
=================

Develop a Calculator that takes a string as input and outputs its calculated result. The operations the 
calculator should support are plus and minus. The Calculator should return an Integer that represents 
the correctly calculated operation. For example: when the calculator is given the string '1 + 3 - 5' as 
input it should return the integer -1. The calculator does not need to cater for more than 4 parameters 
and the characters in the input it need to be able to handle numbers (integers up to 1000) and the 
characters '+' and '-'. The calculator handling whitespaces (ignoring them) is optional.
